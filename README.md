# blr: Boilerplate

This is a small program written in C that creates boilerplate starter files for computer languages. This started as a little script, thats only purpose was to make a file that is executable automatically, so I could write bash scripts without having to manually make them executable. But, over time, the script got bigger and bigger as I added more template files to make. So, I decided to make it an actual program, with much better functionality. Enjoy!
